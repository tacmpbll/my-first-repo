### Geography

I live out of a carryon and a laptop bag;
 I have hunting land in the lowcountry and
 a cabin near a ski resort.


### Reading

I read non-fiction, like Unix tutorials :)


### Food

I prefer crustaceans and wildgame. 


### Contact

I respond to smoke signals launched from [Carolina Moutains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountains_in_North_Carolina)
